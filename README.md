# NodeJS Novice Samples

![A shiny book!](http://i.imgur.com/9hNJXAC.png)

> Some samples of code that i've written when learning NodeJS.

This is the code that i've written while following the awesome [Node.js in Action](http://www.manning.com/cantelon/) book from [Mike Cantelon](https://github.com/mcantelon), [Marc Harter](https://github.com/wavded), [T.J. Holowaychuk](github.com/visionmedia) and [Nathan Rajlich](https://github.com/TooTallNate).

What you'll see further is all things that i've done based on the book. The sections and the content reference are just based on the book and not just the same. I do not have any rights on the book, this is all education centered.

Each section folder will contain a `README` explaining the core thinks that the section has and also a separate `package.json` file.


## Disclaimer

This is under constant production :bowtie:


The files are more well-structured and even more heavily commented after `7-connect-builtin-middleware`. Some day i'll go back and redo the other stuff before it. *(5-storing-data is a bit cool).*
