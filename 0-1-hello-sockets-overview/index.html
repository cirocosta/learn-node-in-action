    // here we'll initialize the socket.io client code. It will, then,
    // decide on the transport to utilize to connect. That's because
    // socketio aims to bring a websocket-like api to many browsers and
    // devices (multi-transport support).


    // making a connection from this browser to the socketio server that is configure for the following url
    var socket = io.connect('http://localhost:3000');

    // performing the connection, a simple HTTP  handshake will then
    // take place. If successful, will result in the client receiving a
    // session id, a number of seconds within which a heartbeat is
    // expected (the heartbeat timeout) and the number of seconds after
    // the transport connection is closed when then socket is considered
    // disconnected if the transport connection is not reopened.


    // register this client to listen to the 'news' event.
    socket.on('news', function (data) {
        console.log(data);
        // emit this event 'my other event' with the data to send `{my: 'data'}`
        socket.emit('my other event', { my: 'data' });
    });
